Stream webcams/video and audio over a network/internet

Working but also WIP project

This is mostly aimed as being a cheap home security setup. With a single laptop and a cheap webcam it should be easy to create a dual camera setup which can allow for recording what goes on as well as a live feed of the video being accessible from a remote location via phone or other device. Supports as many cameras as you can connect to the device (bar USB bandwidth limitations). Also perfect for keeping an eye on pets while out, or watching who keeps taking your food from the communal fridge!
